# WienJ

## CAPABILITIES 
We present an open-source software package WIENJ, a software to estimate magnetic interactions based on combining magnetic force theorem and linear-response approach.  As an interface to the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) software Wien2k, the software allows to friendly and efficiently calculate anisotropic spin Hamiltonian parameters, including Heisenberg interaction, antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and symmetric Gamma term.
